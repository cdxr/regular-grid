### regular-grid

`regular-grid` is a Haskell library for performing operations on regular planar
2d graphs. It seeks to abstract over various distance metrics to provide a
common interface for searching and pathfinding.

This library could be useful in the creation of 2d games that are based on 
regular tilings, including:

    * squares (manhattan distance)
    * squares (chebyshev distance)
    * hexagons
    * triangles (TODO)
